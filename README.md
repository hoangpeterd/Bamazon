# Bamazon

### Overview
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront built with Node.js and MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

### Walkthrough
Upon starting Bamazon the customer will be assigned a unique ID and presented with a table of the products for sale.

For Example:

ITEM ID | PRODUCT NAME | DEPARTMENT NAME | PRICE | STOCK QUANTITY
---|---|---|---|---
 1 | Inception | Movies | 10 | 100 
 5 | Wolfenstein: The New Order | Games | 20 | 100

- The customer will then be prompted to select the ITEM ID of the product they would like to buy.
- A second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
